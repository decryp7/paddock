# paddock-dev (`./dev`)

The developer and CI tool of ADR 0022. Run it with `./dev <command>` (`dev.cmd` on Windows) from anywhere in the repository.

- **Binary cache.** `./dev` names the binary by an input hash (`inputs.txt` plus the compiler cargo uses) and keeps it in
  `$PADDOCK_DEV_HOME/bin/<hash>/` (default `~/.paddock-dev`). **Agents set `PADDOCK_DEV_HOME=/Volumes/d7sst7/dev-targets/paddock-dev-home`
  (never a folder in `~`); CI sets it under `PADDOCK_CI_HOME`. Tests always use a temporary `PADDOCK_DEV_HOME`.**
- **Build folder.** A miss, or uncommitted changes under an input path, builds into `$PADDOCK_DEV_TARGET_DIR`
  (default `tools/paddock-dev/target/`, ignored by git). Agents point it outside `~`, with `CARGO_BUILD_JOBS=2`, through `heavy.sh`.
- **Release jobs** set `PADDOCK_DEV_FRESH=1`: build from source in a fresh folder, no compiler wrapper.
- Commands today: `self hash`, `ci slot acquire|release|status`, `wait`, `graph affected`. `wait --plock <name> | --pid <pid> | --file <path> --line <regex> | --ci-run <id>` with a required `--max <duration>` is the one way for agents and scripts to wait: phase lines on standard error, an `::error::` line and the next step at the limit (never an endless wait); `--plock` reads plock's activity log (lines written after the wait began, `--include-past` for earlier ones), `--pid` checks pid and start time, `--ci-run` reads `GITEA_TOKEN` from the environment and never prints it. `ci slot acquire` prints `sN <token>` (JSON:
  `slot`, `token`); `release --slot sN --token <token>` frees only the holder that token belongs to. The holder is a detached process
  started in the CI home; it ends when the `--owner` job folder is gone, so run the tool from outside that folder. `--json` writes one object; exit codes are
  `paddock-cli`'s (2 usage, 4 refused, ...).
- When a path dependency in `crates/` changes its dependencies, regenerate this lockfile in the same change.

## Not ported yet (R0b gaps, listed on purpose)

`graph affected` reproduces `scripts/affected.mjs`'s plan for a file list, a base and head revision, and `--all` (recorded cases in
`tests/golden/`, and the script itself as a live oracle while it exists). Not ported until R4: `--ci` (the base from the event, the
Gitea API for the last green run, the job outputs and summary), `--app` / `PLAN_APP`, the CI matrix legs and nextest narrowing.
The `dev-build` job (one build per run for a hash nobody published, shared as a run artifact) and `setup-rust`'s image fast path are R0b too. Done: `dev-tool.yml` publishes the binary per input hash and runner kind, and the `dev` wrapper downloads it in CI (locally with `PADDOCK_DEV_DOWNLOAD=1`), checks its checksum and embedded hash, and builds on any miss or doubt.
